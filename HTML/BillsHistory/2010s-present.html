                    <p>The beginning of the 2010s for the Bills was defined by the ongoing playoff
                    drought. Despite some solid seasons with players like Ryan Fitzpatrick and Marcell
                    Dareus, the Bills couldn't manage to crack a playoff spot. This continued through
                    multiple more attempts at finding a quarterback, with chances given to EJ Manuel, Tyrod
                    Taylor, and others. The 2015 season was the first season under the new owners, the Pegula
                    family. In 2017, head coach Sean McDermott and general manager Brandon Beane were hired.
                    This marked a turning point as for the first time in 17 seasons, the Bills made the playoffs
                    in 2017. In 2018, the Bills drafted quarterback Josh Allen. Allen had a decent rookie campaign,
                    but the Bills did not make the playoffs. The Allen-led Bills rebounded in 2019, with a playoff
                    appearance, but wild card round loss to the Houston Texans. In 2020, The Bills traded for wide
                    reciever Stefon Diggs, and after another strong season, the Bills won the AFC East. After a wild
                    card round win against the Colts and Divisional round win against the Ravens, they fell to the Chiefs
                    in the AFC championship game. 2021 was a similar season for the Bills, posting a strong season, but falling
                    again to the Chiefs, this time in the divisional round. In 2022, the Bills faced a lot of adversity off
                    the field, but still managed to make the divsional round, where they lost to the Bengals. In 20223, they
                    suffered another Divisional round loss to the Chiefs.</p>
