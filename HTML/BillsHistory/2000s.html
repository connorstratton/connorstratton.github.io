                    <p>The 2000s for the Bills were defined by the playoff drought. The 2001 and 2002
                    teams were abysmal, but things looked a little better with the signing of quarterback
                    Drew Bledsoe in 2002. They finished the season at 8-8, but still managed to place last
                    in the division. In 2003, the Bills started with a few strong wins, but stumbled for
                    the rest of the season, and finished 6-10. After that year, the Bills quarterback struggles
                    started, with attempts from mutilpe replacements failing, leading to more and more losing seasons.
                    With some signings and draft picks, things started looking up towards the end of the decade.</p>
